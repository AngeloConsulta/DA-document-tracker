# Document Tracking System - Updated Flowchart Prompt

## System Overview
Create a comprehensive flowchart for a Laravel-based Document Tracking System designed for the Department of Agriculture. This is a full-scale, maintainable system with role-based access control, document lifecycle management, QR code integration, and real-time tracking capabilities.

## Updated Core System Architecture

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization Flow
```
START → User Login → Authentication Check → Role Verification → Permission Assignment → Role-Based Dashboard Access
```

**Updated User Roles Hierarchy:**
- **Superadmin**: Full system access across all departments
- **Admin**: Department-level access with user management and department access
- **Department User**: Limited access to assigned department documents with document creation and routing capabilities

### 2. Updated Role-Based Access Control Flow

#### Login & Access Control Decision Tree
```
START → User Login → Authentication Success → Role Check
├── IF Superadmin → All Access Granted
│   ├── Dashboard Access
│   ├── Scanner Access  
│   ├── All Documents Access
│   ├── Incoming Documents Access
│   ├── Outgoing Documents Access
│   ├── Department Management Access
│   ├── User Management Access
│   └── System Configuration Access
├── IF Admin → Limited Access Granted
│   ├── Dashboard Access
│   ├── Scanner Access
│   ├── All Documents Access (Department Filtered)
│   ├── Incoming Documents Access (Department Filtered)
│   ├── Outgoing Documents Access (Department Filtered)
│   └── Department Access (Own Department Only)
└── IF Department User → Restricted Access Granted
    ├── Dashboard Access (Own Department)
    ├── Scanner Access
    ├── All Documents Access (Own Department)
    ├── Incoming Documents Access (Own Department)
    ├── Outgoing Documents Access (Own Department)
    └── Document Creation & Routing Access
```

### 3. Document Creation & Routing Flow (Department User Focus)

#### Document Creation Process (Department User)
```
Department User Login → Dashboard → Outgoing Documents Page → Create New Document
├── Document Details Entry
│   ├── Title & Description
│   ├── Document Type Selection
│   ├── Department Assignment (Auto-assigned to user's department)
│   ├── File Upload
│   └── Priority & Due Date
├── QR Code Generation → Document History Log → Status Assignment
└── Document Created Successfully → Display in All Documents Page
```

#### Document Forwarding Process (Department User)
```
Department User → Outgoing Documents Page → Select Document → Forward Action
├── Forward to Department Selection
│   ├── Choose Target Department
│   ├── Assign to Specific User (Optional)
│   ├── Add Remarks/Notes
│   └── Set Priority Level
├── Document Status Update → "Forwarded" Status
├── Document History Log → Routing Entry
├── Notification Creation → Target Department User Alert
└── Document Appears in Target User's Incoming Documents Page
```

#### Document Flow Between Departments
```
Department A User Creates Document → Outgoing Documents Page → Forward to Department B
├── Document Status: "Outgoing" → "Forwarded"
├── Document History: Routing Entry Created
├── Notification: Department B User Notified
└── Department B User → Incoming Documents Page → Document Received
    ├── Document Status: "Incoming" → "Received"
    ├── Document History: Receipt Entry Created
    └── Document Available for Processing
```

### 4. Updated Document Lifecycle Management Flow

#### Incoming Documents Processing
```
Document Received → Incoming Documents Page → User Action
├── Document Review → Status Update
├── Document Processing → Internal Routing
├── Document Approval → Status Change
└── Document Completion → Archive/Forward
```

#### Outgoing Documents Management
```
Document Creation → Outgoing Documents Page → Document Management
├── Document Draft → Save for Later
├── Document Ready → Forward to Department
├── Document Sent → Status Update
└── Document Tracking → History Log
```

### 5. Navigation & Interface Flow

#### Department User Navigation Flow
```
Login → Department Dashboard → Quick Actions → 
Recent Documents → Department Statistics → Notifications → END
```

### 2. Document Management Interface (Department User)
```
Document List → Filter/Search → Document Details → 
Create New Document → Edit/Update → Status Change → 
Forward/Route → History View → Export → END
```

### 3. QR Scanner Interface
```
Scanner Access → Camera Permission → QR Scan → 
Document Display → Status Update → Action Log → END
```

## Administrative Functions

### 1. User Management Flow (Superadmin Only)
```
Superadmin Access → User List → Create/Edit User → 
Role Assignment → Department Assignment → 
Permission Verification → Save → END
```

### 2. Department Management Flow (Admin/Superadmin)
```
Admin/Superadmin Access → Department List → Create/Edit Department → 
User Assignment → Document Assignment → Save → END
```

### 3. System Configuration Flow (Superadmin Only)
```
Superadmin Access → System Settings → Document Types → 
Status Configuration → Permission Matrix → Save → END
```

## Reporting & Analytics Flow

### 1. Document Statistics (Role-Based)
```
Data Collection → Role-Based Filtering → Department Analysis → 
Status Analysis → Time Tracking → Performance Metrics → 
Report Generation → Export Options → END
```

### 2. Audit Trail
```
Action Logging → User Tracking → Document History → 
Status Changes → Routing Logs → Access Logs → Export → END
```

## Security & Compliance Flow

### 1. Access Control
```
Request → Authentication → Authorization → Role Check → 
Department Filter → Permission Verification → 
Action Execution → Audit Log → END
```

### 2. Data Protection
```
Data Access → Encryption Check → Secure Transmission → 
Access Logging → Compliance Verification → END
```

## Error Handling & Recovery Flow

### 1. System Errors
```
Error Detection → Error Logging → User Notification → 
Recovery Attempt → Fallback Options → END
```

### 2. Data Validation
```
Input Validation → Error Detection → User Feedback → 
Correction → Re-validation → END
```

## Flowchart Design Requirements

### Visual Elements
- Use different shapes for different types of processes
- Include decision diamonds for role-based access control
- Show parallel processes for different user roles
- Use color coding for different user roles (Superadmin: Purple, Admin: Blue, Department User: Green)
- Include swim lanes for different system components
- Show document flow between departments with arrows

### Documentation Elements
- Clear process labels for each role
- Decision points with role-based conditions
- Error handling paths for unauthorized access
- Success/failure outcomes for document operations
- Integration points for notifications
- Security checkpoints for department access

### System Integration Points
- Database interactions with role-based filtering
- External API calls with authentication
- File system operations with department restrictions
- Email/SMS notifications for document forwarding
- QR code generation/scanning with access control
- Export functionality with role-based data filtering

This updated flowchart should provide a comprehensive visual representation of the entire Document Tracking System, showing how all components interact based on user roles, how documents flow between departments, and how the system enforces role-based access control throughout the document lifecycle.
