# Document Tracking System - Flowchart Prompt

## System Overview
Create a comprehensive flowchart for a Laravel-based Document Tracking System designed for the Department of Agriculture. This is a full-scale, maintainable system with role-based access control, document lifecycle management, QR code integration, and real-time tracking capabilities.

## Core System Architecture

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization Flow
```
START → User Login → Authentication Check → Role Verification → Permission Assignment → Dashboard Access
```

**User Roles Hierarchy:**
- **Superadmin**: Full system access across all departments
- **Admin**: Department-level access with user management
- **Department User**: Limited access to assigned department documents

### 2. Document Lifecycle Management Flow

#### Document Creation Process
```
START → User Authentication → Document Type Selection → Department Assignment → 
Document Details Entry → File Upload → QR Code Generation → Status Assignment → 
Document History Log → Notification Creation → END
```

#### Document Routing & Forwarding Flow
```
Document Created → Status Check → Department Assignment → User Assignment → 
Forward Decision → Route to Department/User → Update Status → 
History Log → Notification → Recipient Action → Status Update → Loop
```

#### Document Status Tracking Flow
```
Document Received → Initial Status → Processing → Review → Approval → 
Final Status → Archive/Complete → History Log → END
```

### 3. QR Code Integration Flow

#### QR Code Generation
```
Document Created → Generate Unique QR Code → Store QR Data → 
Create QR Image → Link to Document → Save to Storage → 
Download/Print Options → END
```

#### QR Code Scanning Process
```
QR Code Scan → Decode Data → Document Lookup → Access Verification → 
Status Update → History Log → Notification → END
```

### 4. Document Access Control Flow

#### Permission-Based Access
```
User Request → Authentication → Role Check → Permission Verification → 
Department Filter → Document Access → View/Edit/Delete → 
Action Log → END
```

#### Document Filtering
```
User Login → Role Determination → Department Assignment → 
Query Filtering → Department-Specific Results → Display → END
```

User Assignment → Document Assignment → Save → END
```

### 3. System Configuration Flow
```
Superadmin Access → System Settings → Document Types → 
Status Configuration → Permission Matrix → Save → END
```

## Reporting & Analytics Flow

### 1. Document Statistics
```
Data Collection → Department Filtering → Status Analysis → 
Time Tracking → Performance Metrics → Report Generation → 
Export Options → END
```

### 2. Audit Trail
```
Action Logging → User Tracking → Document History → 
Status Changes → Access Logs → Export → END
```

## Notification System Flow

### 1. Real-time Notifications
```
Event Trigger → Notification Creation → User Assignment → 
Message Generation → Delivery → Read Status → END
```

### 2. Email Notifications
```
Status Change → Email Trigger → Template Selection → 
Content Generation → Email Send → Delivery Confirmation → END
```

## Export & Integration Flow

### 1. Data Export
```
Export Request → Data Filtering → Format Selection → 
File Generation → Download → END
```

### 2. API Integration
```
External Request → Authentication → Permission Check → 
Data Retrieval → Response Generation → END
```

## Security & Compliance Flow

### 1. Access Control
```
Request → Authentication → Authorization → Permission Check → 
Department Filter → Action Execution → Audit Log → END
```

### 2. Data Protection
```
Data Access → Encryption Check → Secure Transmission → 
Access Logging → Compliance Verification → END
```

## Error Handling & Recovery Flow

### 1. System Errors
```
Error Detection → Error Logging → User Notification → 
Recovery Attempt → Fallback Options → END
```

### 2. Data Validation
```
Input Validation → Error Detection → User Feedback → 
Correction → Re-validation → END
```

## Maintenance & Monitoring Flow
